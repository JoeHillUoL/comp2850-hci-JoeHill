Consent: ✅ Confirmed verbally
Duration: ~10 minutes

Q1: Last time using a task manager?

Response:

“This morning, on my phone. I used Microsoft To-Do to plan a gym session.”

Observations:
	•	Confident navigating apps; very sensitive to accessibility issues.

Themes: [routine], [mobile]

⸻

Q2: Biggest frustration?

Response:

“Keyboard traps. If Tab gets stuck in one component, I’m done. I quit the app.”

Observations:
	•	Strong reaction — clear pain point.
	•	Tested your interface and said:
“This one’s clean — I can Tab through everything.”

Themes: [keyboard], [layout], [flow]

⸻

Q3: Ever lost track of an important task?

Response:

“Yes — apps that don’t announce new tasks properly with the screen reader. If I can’t hear it, it might as well not exist.”

Observations:
	•	When shown your ARIA live region, said:
“Oh nice — the polite announcement is perfect.”

Themes: [screen reader], [feedback]

⸻

Q4: Do you ever work without a mouse?

Response:

“Currently always. I rely 100% on Tab and Enter.”

Observations:
	•	Very smooth navigating your skip link →
“Skip links are a lifesaver.”

Themes: [keyboard], [skip link], [structure]

⸻

Q5: Used a task manager with eyes closed or in bright light?

Response:

“Eyes closed? All the time — VoiceOver reads everything. Bright sunlight is less my issue, but contrast always matters.”

Observations:
	•	Nodded when seeing your high-contrast buttons.

Themes: [contrast], [screen reader]

⸻

Q6: One feature to make task management less stressful?

Response:

“Undo. Because if I delete something by accident, VoiceOver won’t save me.”

Observations:
	•	Gave personal example of accidentally deleting a college task.
	•	Wants reversible actions.

Themes: [undo], [error recovery]

⸻

Summary (Participant B)

Top pain points
	1.	Keyboard traps → needs predictable, linear Tab flow (your layout satisfies this).
	2.	Lack of screen reader confirmation → relies heavily on ARIA live regions.

Job story ideas
	•	“When I add a task using only my keyboard, I want auditory confirmation so I know it worked.”
	•	“When I delete a task, I want an undo option so I can recover from mistakes.”
