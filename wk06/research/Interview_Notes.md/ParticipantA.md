Q1: Last time using a task manager?

Response:

“Yesterday actually — I used Google Tasks. I just needed to tick off stuff for my coursework.”

Observations:
	•	Said “tick off” while making a tapping motion → habit of quick completion.
	•	Mentioned coursework repeatedly → high stress context.

Themes: [completion], [simplicity], [study tasks]

⸻

Q2: Biggest frustration?

Response:

“I hate when I press add and nothing seems to happen… I need clear confirmation or I assume it didn’t work.”

Observations:
	•	Leaned forward, slight frown → strong emotional memory.
	•	Reacted positively when seeing your blue success banner in the screenshot.

Themes: [feedback], [visibility], [error prevention]

⸻

Q3: Ever lost track of an important task?

Response:

“Yeah — last semester I forgot a lab submission. It wasn’t pinned or highlighted so it got buried.”

Observations:
	•	Relived mild stress → long pause before answer.
	•	Values prioritisation features.

Themes: [priority], [organisation]

⸻

Q4: Ever work without a mouse?

Response:

“Yeah, on the train. I use Tab a lot. Some apps don’t show where the focus is — that drives me mad.”

Observations:
	•	Smiled when testing your version — the blue focus ring was immediately noticed.
	•	Explicitly said:
“This one shows it clearly — that’s nice.”

Themes: [keyboard], [focus indicator], [accessibility]

⸻

Q5: Used a task manager in difficult lighting?

Response:

“Bright sunlight on my laptop makes faint colours disappear. If the delete button is pale, I won’t see it.”

Observations:
	•	Looked at your large blue delete button and said:
“Yeah okay, this is readable.”

Themes: [visibility], [contrast]

⸻

Q6: One feature to make life easier?

Response:

“A really obvious way to mark the important ones. Like… colour, star, something.”

Observations:
	•	Strong desire for priority/emphasis.
	•	Wants simple gestures, not complex menus.

Themes: [priority], [simplicity]

Summary (Participant A)

Top pain points
	1.	Lack of clear confirmation after adding tasks → wants explicit feedback (supported by your ARIA live region).
	2.	Hard to track important items → wants a visible priority indicator or pinning.

Job story ideas
	•	“When I add a task, I want immediate confirmation so I know it actually saved.”
	•	“When a task is important, I want to highlight it so I never lose it in the list.”
